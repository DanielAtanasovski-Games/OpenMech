# Dedicated Server

The server is designed to be hosted seperate to the client (can be on the same machine of course) 
with the following features / goals:

- Entirely Authoritive (WIP)
- A Master Server that points to all dedicated servers
  - Work in a docker environment to spin up new servers
  - Allow Clients to "Host" games that just spin up new instances through docker
- Moddable allowing servers to dictate stats and gamemodes
- Work in a headless environment
