#Creator

The goal of the creator is to provide a GUI to quickly create new vehicles, weapons and maps and convert to json files that 
the server will take and use in multiplayer sessions.

- Creates Json files that can serialize into c# class template of vehicles and weapons
- Send Textures over network? / or just imply the path that would be similar between client and server. AKA data folder
